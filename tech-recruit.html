              <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
              <p>
                Develop a personal portfolio website showcasing your skills,
                projects, and achievements. Your portfolio should include
                multiple sections such as a hero, about me, projects, and
                contact me. Ensure the design is visually appealing. Use 3D
                animations or keep it clean and minimal, itâ€™s up to you. Be
                creative.

              <p>
                Create a website for an upcoming IEEE event. The website should
                allow users to view upcoming events, register for events,
                speaker sessions and submit feedback after attending events.
                Design an intuitive user interface with separate sections for
                event listings, registration forms, and feedback submission.
                (Implementing backend functionality to handle event registration
                and feedback storage will give you an extra edge)(Refer to

              <p>
                Create a website that allows users to input the name of a dish
                and retrieve the recipe for it from an external API such as
                <span

                    class="ref-link"

                  ></span
                >
                or any other similar API of your choice. Design an intuitive
                user interface where users can easily input the dish name and
                view the corresponding recipe. Implement backend functionality
                to fetch data from the API and display it dynamically on the
                website.

                Develop a backend authentication system with SignUp and SignIn
                functions. Users should be able to register for an account by
                providing their email and password, and then login using their
                credentials. (Bonus points will be awarded for implementing JWT
                or any other persistent login systems for enhanced security and
                user experience.)

                IEEE is organizing an event and has set up registration through
                two portals. The participant data received from the two sources
                is given to you in the form of two spreadsheets. Write a script
                to automatically combine the list of participants into a single
                spreadsheet, with columns for Participant Name, Team Name,
                Participant Type (leader/member), Participant Phone Number and
                Participant Email. Make sure to handle edge cases such as
                missing data appropriately.

            factors such as responsive design, use of version-control tools,
