          Oh, would you look at that? Time is up, and I must say, I'm surprised
          you made it through without giving up completely. Bravo! Now, we can't
          keep you in suspense forever, so let's release your rankings and see
          who's going to the finals and who's going to the nearest remedial
          class. Don't worry if you didn't make the cut, there's always next
          year (or the year after that, or the year after that...). And while
          you're waiting to find out your fate, why not take a stroll outside
          and bask in the glorious summer sun? It might help soothe the sting of
          disappointment when you inevitably see your abysmal
          results. Good luck!
